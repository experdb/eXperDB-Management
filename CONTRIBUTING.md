## How to Contribute

3. Please wait until the label changes to `contribution welcome` - otherwise, it is not ready to be worked on.
4. After the label changed to `contribution welcome`, you can start working on the implementation. To avoid any duplicate efforts, it is recommended to update the issue so that other developers see someone working on the issue.
5. Before making a PR, please make sure you fully tested the code. It is highly recommended to provide the test code as well. After submitting the PR, wait for code review and approval. The reviewer may ask you for additional commits or changes.
